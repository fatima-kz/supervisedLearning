# supervisedLearning

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of various supervised learning algorithms. Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs based on the provided examples.

## Algorithms Implemented
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Neural Networks
